      <h2>Just A Little Info About My Background</h2>
      <p>
        i had little knowledge about how to operate computer not until when i
        was done with <br />
        high school then i went into a full computer training on how to actually
        repair a computer <br />
        but then you can't know how to repair a computer without knowing how to
        operate it... <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        seeing the skill i now posess and my love about computer and technology
        started getting stronger <br />
        then i opted to pursue a degree in computer engineering..
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> life in college </b> <br />
        life in college is quite interesting but the older i become i realise
        that what is been taught <br />
        in college is not just enough i need to go extra mile and invest in what
        i actually love and want
      </p>

      <h2>Reason why i joined alt school</h2>
      <p>
        i think its quite simple and its a very easy decision for me : talking
        about investing in what i want and love <br />
        made me buy some specific courses on udemy and i came across alt school
        and seeing what dey have to offer, i thought and <br />
        said why not its a good opportunity for me and also to keep track of
        things i will be learning so basically i want to use the <br />
        pace from alt sch to actually get some of my online courses done.
